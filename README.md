# BT5153 Group 06 ‚Äî Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction

This project focuses on detecting diabetic retinopathy using deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches.  
It combines data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and a web-based demo built using Flask.

## üìÇ Folder Overview

### PythonNotebook/

This folder contains all the Jupyter Notebooks used during the development phase:

| Notebook | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| **DatasetSplit.ipynb** | Prepares the dataset by splitting it into training (70%) , test (15%) , and validation (15%) sets based on image labels. This ensures proper evaluation during model training. |
| **EfficientNetB3+DenseNet_Feature_Extraction_and_Traditional_ML_Classifier.ipynb** | Extracts deep features from retinal images using EfficientNetB3 and DenseNet architectures, then applies traditional machine learning classifiers (such as SVM and Random Forest) to classify diabetic retinopathy severity. |
| **Gaussian_Filter.ipynb** | Applies Gaussian filtering to retinal images to enhance image clarity, reduce noise, and potentially improve feature extraction quality. |

> These notebooks were primarily used for preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

### FlaskWebsite/

This folder contains the complete source code for the web application built using Flask.  
The web app allows users to upload retinal images and get predictions on diabetic retinopathy severity.

**How to run the Flask website:**

1. Install the required packages (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Navigate to the `FlaskWebsite/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd FlaskWebsite
   ```

3. Launch the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:  
   [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

The website will provide a simple interface where users can upload an image and receive a model prediction.

### Other Files and Folders

- **SampleImages/**  
  Contains example retinal images that can be used for testing the Flask application.

- **dataset.txt**  
  Has the google drive link to access the datasets

- **label.csv**  
  A CSV file containing image filenames and their associated diabetic retinopathy labels.

## üìù Notes

- The **PythonNotebook/** and **FlaskWebsite/** are independent. You do not need to run the notebooks to use the web application.
- The pretrained models and feature extraction processes are already integrated into the web app for prediction purposes.
- `dataset.zip` and `label.csv` are mainly for retraining or model experiments, not needed for basic website use.
